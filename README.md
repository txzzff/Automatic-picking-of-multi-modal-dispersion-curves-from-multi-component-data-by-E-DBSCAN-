The two-step clustering script file in numerical simulation can implement Figure 6 and Figure 7 in the text. When implementing the models in Figure 7, it is necessary to modify the parameters.
The two step clustering script file in file data 1 can implement Figure 10 in the text.
The two step clustering script file in file data 2 can implement Figure 13 in the text.
